My take on the infamous 2048 game.

You can see a demo of this project here (#add demo);
You can play around with the game here: (https://discotroop.github.io/react2048/)

Things I would still like to add.
- More CSS styles/animations to make the feel smoother
- Font's scaling with the boxes
- Responsive/Mobile friendly design.

- A general refactor of the game logic and sorting of things in a more sensible way.
- Better test coverage, it would have saved quite few headaches along the way.

Tools Used:
JS, React, HTML 5, CSS, Jest, Git (obviously), github pages.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you'd like to run it locally feel free to download the repository.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
